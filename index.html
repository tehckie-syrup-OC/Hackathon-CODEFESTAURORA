                    Being an artist is one of the most beautiful aspect of humans. Artists are the knot of joining various people together through assoociations, meets, competitions where many people gather together and discuss about the facts and figures of budding artists
                    in the world. This make significant positive changes around people and urge them to be an artist. This makes thing simplier and also through this millions gain confidence who were not been able to gain cooperative and personality objective
                    of their life.

                            The way they describe substituting a paintbrush for a pen demonstrates how similar the branches of the arts can be. It’s not so much about being a painter or a writer; they are two beasts of the same species. We could also guess that creativity of all
                            types essentially draws from the same well of genius.

                            By using the term “art“, Cézanne broadens the topic beyond just painting, although he was a very famous painter. Instead, he includes all forms of creative genius. If they all draw from the same well, it must be a deep water made of intense feelings,
                            as light and dark as the end results.
